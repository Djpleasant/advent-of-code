# 2024

This is the first time I've participated in a community event like this, so I
suspect I'm going to be doing a lot of code referencing from past years and
solutions for this year.

I'll try to link to repos that inspire things I did.

# Goals

- Learn how to use the Python package manager,
[uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv).

- Practice organizing and maintaining a "long-term" project.

- Try out a community event for the first time in this space. 

# Tech Stack

Developed on Ubuntu 22.04 (hosted in Hyper-V on Windows 11).

- [Shell](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/)

    Mostly used as the shell entrypoints to setup your environment
    or execute the Python scripts that actually do the work.

- [Python3.10](https://peps.python.org/pep-0619/)

    Primary scripting language used.

    - [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv)

        Python package manager.
