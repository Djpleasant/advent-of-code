# aoc-python

This is a collection of my [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) attemps
across the years.

In each year directory, there will be a README.md file. This file will detail
what my goals were for this year's AoC. I want to try and use this event as a
way to learn different tools or languages.

So if you are interested in what I was trying to do on a particular year, take
a look at that file.
