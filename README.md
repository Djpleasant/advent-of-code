# advent-of-code

Collection of my attempts at the 
[Advent of Code yearly event](https://adventofcode.com/).

Solutions will be organized by year within their respective language branches:

- [python](https://github.com/Djpleasant/advent-of-code/tree/aoc-python)

- [rust](https://github.com/Djpleasant/advent-of-code/tree/aoc-rust)

# Current goals

- Learn how to use the Python package manager,
[uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv).

- Dip my toes into the [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)y-water and see how
I do.

# Distribution

If something posses you to copy my code examples, please make note of the
[license](https://github.com/Djpleasant/advent-of-code/blob/main/LICENSE).

That lets you do want you want with all this. Have fun and call your mom.
