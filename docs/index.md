# djpleasant - AoC

This is a collection of my [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/)
attempts across the years.

In each year directory, there will be a README.md file. This file will detail
what my goals were for this year's AoC. I want to try and use this event as a
way to learn different tools or languages.

So if you are interested in what I was trying to do on a particular year, take
a look at that file.

One other larger goal is to compile a timeline of my development habits and
various techniques I may pick up during a specific year. I want to do this
because pointing and laughing at past-me is my favorite activity,
but it may also be useful for others to see my work since I intend to keep
things readable.

Will it be testable? I'd be a fool to commit that to the proverbial stone but
I'll try my best.
