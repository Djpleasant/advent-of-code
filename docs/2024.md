[Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024/about)

This is the first time I've participated in a community event like this, so I
suspect I'm going to be doing a lot of code referencing from past years and
solutions for this year.

I'll try to link to repos that inspire things I did.

# Goals

- Learn how to use the Python package manager,
[uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv).

- Practice organizing and maintaining a "long-term" project.

- Try out a community event for the first time in this space. 

# Tech Stack

Developed on Ubuntu 22.04 (hosted in Hyper-V on Windows 11).

- [Shell](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/)

    Mostly used as the shell entrypoints to setup your environment
    or execute the Python scripts that actually do the work.

- [Python3.10](https://peps.python.org/pep-0619/)

    Primary scripting language used.

    - [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv)

        Python package manager.

# Days

## Day 01

- Spent of a lot of time moving things around. Making sure this project can be
    maintained year-to-year is argubly the most important goal to me, so it'll
    be worth it (hopefully).

## Day 02

- Spend more time reworking parts of day one.

- Found a good boilerplate to use for the future days.

- Got stuck big time because I misread the requirements and never bothered
    to go back and make sure I understood it. Something something learning
    experience.

- After finishing the solution for this, I opted to pivot to larger project
    management stuff (like this very document).

## Day 03

- Enhanced boilerplate. Moved a common function to a utils file.

- Reworked day 01 and 02 to work with new boilerplate.

- I did ask Copilot to generate the day one regex pattern, but then used
  [regexr](https://regexr.com/) to play with the conditional matches.
